This project is part of the front-end curriculum for the University of Washington Part-time Coding Bootcamp, presented by Trilogy Education. It served as a light introduction to Javascript conditional scripting with dynamic writing to the DOM. 

Minimally, the goal was to create operable Javascript that receives a user action via keyboard interaction and generate a random computer output of r (rock), p (paper), or s (scissors), and then compare the two inputs for a win or lose state, tracked by a counter. All resulting outputs are then reflected in elements in the DOM.

------

To make the game more enjoyable to play, I made additional changes to the program to allow user input via buttons and click events rather than keyboard entry. I also added page layout and visual styling with CSS, and added dynamic image sources to show the user and computer plays for each throw.

CHALLENGES: 

The initial challenges required 
* Setting basic variables with user input and function calls
* Running those variable inputs through conditional logic to output a win/loss result
* Write the results to the DOM

The additional challenges presented by my personal touches included:
* Adding onClick listeners for each of the buttons for available user inputs
* Containing game logic within a function call to run once user selection is made
* Using the game results to trigger image changes in the DOM
* Adding additional styling to the page to look nice and present game information with a logical heirarchy.
